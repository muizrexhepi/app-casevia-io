Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:

  Paragraph 3: What were the stakes? What would happen if they didn't solve this?

7. If critical info is missing, use null or provide general descriptions
8. Maintain professional B2B tone throughout

QUOTE GUIDELINES:
- Only include quotes that are clear, complete thoughts
- Remove filler words like "um", "uh", "like" for readability

- Percentage changes: "40% increase", "60% reduction"
- Time savings: "Saved 10 hours per week", "Cut onboarding time by 50%"
- Cost impact: "Reduced costs by $50K annually", "ROI of 300%"
- Multipliers: "3x lead generation", "5x faster processing"
- If no numbers, use: "Significantly improved", "Dramatically reduced", "Substantially increased"
